# EC01 Site Genetics

The site genetics needed to recreate the skeleton for the community. The author has actual, real-life experience on a genetics operation where he worked for four years as a barn manager and then as a health supervisor focusing on health and developing a computer production system using Access as a database. This set of files follows a pattern developed for WordPress which uses its own API (programming interface) to construct the site based on a set of text files.

Status: Not yet developed.
